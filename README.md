# Inconsistent Hover States with Background Colors in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using hover states with background colors in Tailwind CSS. The problem arises when attempting to apply a hover effect to a child element (e.g., a button) within a parent element with its own background color. This can result in the hover state not affecting the background color as expected, leading to inconsistent visual effects.

## Bug

The provided `bug.js` file contains an example where a button with a hover state is placed inside a div with a background color. Applying the hover state to the button does not change the background color, resulting in an inconsistent visual appearance.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a solution to resolve this inconsistency. By appropriately applying classes to parent and child elements, or using utilities like `@apply` to combine styles, the desired hover effect can be achieved, ensuring a consistent visual experience.
